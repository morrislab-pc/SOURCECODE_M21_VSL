#Description: This text file gives an in depth description of how I came to conclude which of the five versions
appears to be the most updated version. 

Check which version of m21 AB is the correct version:

Possible Correct versions: 

FIN__AB__M21_221108_ani_version-w10-PsyLab2.osexp

FIN__AB__M21_221108_ani_version.osexp

FIN__AB__M21_221108_ani_version_targ_type_removed.osexp

FIN__AB__M21__112022.osexp

Morph21.osexp #Dr. Morris said this version is not the right one 

Now we're left with: 

FIN__AB__M21_221108_ani_version-w10-PsyLab2.osexp

FIN__AB__M21_221108_ani_version.osexp

FIN__AB__M21_221108_ani_version_targ_type_removed.osexp

FIN__AB__M21__112022.osexp

To compare which version is the correct one I first checked whether each of them sends triggers correctly,
I sat down and connected the actichamp to the amplifier and started recording while running each version of the 
experiment. I watched each version and they all seem to send triggers correctly. This did not help much with 
figuring out the differences, so the next step is to compare each source code and what differentiates them. 

To compare each version, I used Github's version control capabilities and just copied and pasted one version over 
the other. Then I tracked the changes to compare the differences in each source code. 

When comparing FIN__AB__M21_221108_ani_version.osexp & FIN__AB__M21_221108_ani_version_targ_type_removed.osexp
the only difference is that in FIN__AB__M21_221108_ani_version_targ_type_removed.osexp 'targ_type' is removed,
it appears that FIN__AB__M21_221108_ani_version_targ_type_removed.osexp is an updated version of 
FIN__AB__M21_221108_ani_version.osexp

So now we can remove FIN__AB__M21_221108_ani_version.osexp from list of possibilities and now we're 
down to 3 versions to choose: 

FIN__AB__M21_221108_ani_version-w10-PsyLab2.osexp

FIN__AB__M21_221108_ani_version_targ_type_removed.osexp

FIN__AB__M21__112022.osexp

I then compared FIN__AB__M21_221108_ani_version_targ_type_removed.osexp with FIN__AB__M21__112022.osexp
the differences was that FIN__AB__M21_221108_ani_version_targ_type_removed.osexp set the path to "updated port" 
and Ani also added more code to the end of FIN__AB__M21_221108_ani_version_targ_type_removed.osexp which 
appears to send triggers for targets and words. Thus, it appears that FIN__AB__M21_221108_ani_version_targ_type_removed.osexp
is an updated version of FIN__AB__M21__112022.osexp

So no we can remove FIN__AB__M21__112022.osexp from the list of possible versions and now we're down to 2 yay!!
the two left are: 
FIN__AB__M21_221108_ani_version-w10-PsyLab2.osexp

FIN__AB__M21_221108_ani_version_targ_type_removed.osexp

I compared FIN__AB__M21_221108_ani_version-w10-PsyLab2.osexp with FIN__AB__M21_221108_ani_version_targ_type_removed.osexp
A difference I found was in FIN__AB__M21_221108_ani_version-w10-PsyLab2.osexp the path included 'jmorris' so the 
file changed in Dr. Morris' account rather than in Ani's. Also, in FIN__AB__M21_221108_ani_version-w10-PsyLab2.osexp
'cond_trig' was changed to 'cond_trigger', so the programmer changed the variable name to be more descriptive. 
Another change I noticed was that in FIN__AB__M21_221108_ani_version-w10-PsyLab2.osexp it removed 
'define inline_script targ_type' an unused function that was left over in 
FIN__AB__M21_221108_ani_version_targ_type_removed.osexp 

Therefore, it appears that FIN__AB__M21_221108_ani_version-w10-PsyLab2.osexp is the version that has the correct port, 
removed targ_type, has 'word_trigger' rather than word_trig as variable name making it more descriptive, and 
also does not have 'define inline_script targ_type' an unused function, and appears to send triggers correctly 
upon visual inspection. 

So now we are just left with FIN__AB__M21_221108_ani_version-w10-PsyLab2.osexp 

This appears to be the most updated version.
